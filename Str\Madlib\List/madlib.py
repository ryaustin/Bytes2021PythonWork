MAD LIBS is one of the world’s fun word games. Some would even call it one of the ‘GREATEST WORD GAME”. If you enjoy playing around with words, then you probably agree with this phrase.
MadLibs is a phrasal template word game where one player prompts others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story/poem/rhyme before reading aloud. The game is frequently played as a party game or as a pastime(Wikipedia).
