  - let's practice what' we've learned
  - create a bad variable to store your name
  - create two variables, one to store an int and one to store a float

** Why are comments important? ***
reference: https://youtu.be/rhF1x2lnRQA

Imagine you're working on a yearlong app or software for a client, you deliver the product and the client is happy. 
Now fast forward a few years or months and the client would like some updates to the app and because you wrote the software its your responsibliity to maintine it.  
Without comments you'll forget the reasons why you wrote a certain peice of code a certain way and you will end up spending a lot of time looking at your own code trying to explain it.

Comments are even more important when working with a group, it makes it easy to explain to other developers or clubmates to understand and use your code.

That being said, comments are not a substitute to explain poorly written code. You should always strive to write clean understandable code and then use comments as an addition.

Wrapup on comments: 
  - Comments are hints that we can add to our program to makde the code easier to understand.
  - In python, comments start with the # symbol.
  - a shortcut in python to create the # symbol is ctrl+/ (backslash) or cmd+/
  - Comments can also be used for debugging code.
  - Python does'nt have multiline comments. However, we can use multiline strings '''like this''' to act like multiline comments.
